# Editor

Wanna to edit your image without spending a lot
of time in editing one photo then use Editor
to edit whatever images you took in daily basis.

Its not an ordinary ai or software but a useful
product where you just have to discribe what you want to edit and automatically it will edit that part in a better way.

# What i use

I have used python for back-end work and for front-end work html , css , js and it took a lot time just because am new to ai.

Python Module : 

• flask
• cv2
• uuid

## Features

For now,
You could convert the images into black and white
But on Next update you could upload image and edit with much more features.

## Installation

run code on replit :
• pip install flask
• pip install opencv-python
• pip install opencv-python-headless
